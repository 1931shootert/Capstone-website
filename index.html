        <h2>The very first shooter team was formed with three original members with the hopes of playing a couple tournaments. We had to borrow jerseys and ended up playing 3 tournaments that year losing every game! lol but what we found was the need for a team that accepted any player from any nation to become part of the shooter "nation" family. 10 years later we have had hundreds of youth wear our new colors and oh yes we won a few games along the way</h2>

                    The Philosophy of the Shooter Nation:
                    The team started out as the "Little Shooters"but eventually we began calling our team the "Shooter Nation"as over time we bacame not only a family on the field but off it as well. The first principle of the team is everyone gets to play and if your family asks us for their child to play if we have room we NEVER say no. Second we win as a team but also lose as a team in a respectful positive manner. Over time we realized the importance to our youth to feel a sense of belonging and to be part of a "real" team . The unfortunate circumstances as to why we started our team was for children who no other teams wanted for athletic as well as social reasons. I am very proud to say after a winless first season we stuck together and wouldnt you know it started attracting the kind of families with the same vision and principles. And we became CHAMPIONS on and off the field. I refer to the little shooters as MY kids to this day and what I am most proud of is to still have a strong connection to all of my kids years later. They gave me the inspiration to keep fighting for my life the "Shooter Way" the shooter family lasts a lifetime. I survived and fought for my kids as i knew I had to show them that their is always hope and to never give up. My goal was to get back on the sidelines after a 3 year absense fighting for my life and I am proud to say in 2024 the Big Shooter made it back to my kids for the greatest reunion ever.

                            After 3 years away from my kids I was able to make a return to coach for 1 tournament and it was the ultimate reward to myself as my life has come full circle. I realized that as much as my kids needed me i needed them more. I plan on providing space for as long as I am needed. I have a feeling the shooters will continue to be needed.
